BetterSMTP MOD for phpBB2

This is purely a repository for the [BetterSMTP MOD](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=345265&hilit=better+smpt) developed by [ByteWize](http://www.bytewize.com). This is not my code but it is old code and it has been removed from the original source, so I am going to make a repository here for future reference.

**Beware** that I could not get this to work for my version of phpBB2.

However I have taken a lot of the structure from this MOD when creating the [SMTP PHPMailer MOD](https://github.com/konsulting/PHPMailer) that does work for me.
